## Site: lenta.ru
url\_extractor.py --- mapper. Require: file urls.txt (docids and corresponding urls).
url\_extractor\_run.sh --- script for running mapreduce task with url_extractor.py

## PageRank:
init\_mapper.py --- transform graph (url\_extractor's output) into graph with pageranks.
init\_run.sh --- script for running mapreduce task with init\_mapper.py

pagerank\_mapper.py and pagerank\_reducer --- compute pagerank for lenta.ru
pagerank\_run.sh --- script for running pagerank task. (By default 5 iteration)

run.sh = init\_run.sh + pagerank_run.sh

top30.py --- locally compute top30. Read from stdin.
top30.txt --- results after 5 iterations.

## HITS:
init\_mapper.py and init\_reducer.py --- transform graph (url\_extractor's output) into graph with authority and hub ranks. Add inverse edges.
init\_run.sh --- script for running mapreduce task with init\_mapper.py and init\_reducer.py

hits\_mapper.py and hits\_reducer --- HITS for lenta.ru
hitsk\_run.sh --- script for running HITS task. (By default 5 iteration)

run.sh = init\_run.sh + hits_run.sh

top30.py --- locally compute top30. Read from stdin.
top30.txt --- results after 5 iterations.
